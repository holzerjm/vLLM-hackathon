# TOA vLLM / LLM-D Hackathon — Attendee Environment Guide

**Date:** April 25, 2026 | **Location:** The Open Accelerator, Fortpoint, Boston

---

## Getting Started (< 2 minutes)

Every team gets a pre-configured GPU cloud instance on NVIDIA Brev — no local setup required. Your mentor will share a Launchable link for your track. Click it, sign in to Brev, and you'll have a running environment with models pre-loaded and tools installed.

Once your instance is up:

```bash
# 1. Validate everything is working
bash /workspace/test_setup.sh

# 2. Start the LLM server
bash /workspace/start_vllm_server.sh    # (Tier 1)
bash /workspace/serving/serve_8b_baseline.sh  # (Tier 2/3)

# 3. Test it
python3 /workspace/test_client.py
```

Your vLLM server exposes an **OpenAI-compatible API** at `http://localhost:8000/v1` — use it with any OpenAI client library, LangChain, or plain HTTP requests.

> 📝 **Pre-event prep note:** the event page lists **Podman** in the prerequisite tools. Brev instances ship with **Docker** — functionally equivalent for our purposes. If you're running a demo on your laptop (ZeroClaw or NemoClaw), Docker is required specifically for NemoClaw's OpenShell sandbox. Podman works everywhere else.

> 🏆 **Prize reminder:** the event has a dedicated **Best Upstream Contribution** prize and gives 3/20 judging points for open-source contribution. Every starter kit in [`projects/`](projects/) calls out specific upstream PR opportunities — look for the "Submission angles" section at the bottom of each project README.

### Track 5: Agentic Edge powered by NemoClaw 🏆 (NVIDIA GPU Prize)
Build high-accuracy, steerable agents on top of vLLM using NemoClaw's sandboxed runtime. Three tiers:

- **Starter** — vibe-code an agent UI with Cursor on the starter template
- **Builder** — extend the multi-turn customer support reference agent with your own tools
- **Deep Tech** — implement custom steering and benchmark latency across inference profiles

```bash
# (Tier 4 Launchable — see launchable-configs/tier4-nemoclaw/)
# 1. Start vLLM with tool-calling enabled
bash /workspace/start_vllm_server.sh

# 2. Onboard NemoClaw against the local vLLM endpoint
bash /workspace/onboard_nemoclaw.sh

# 3. Connect to the sandbox and run the reference agent
nemoclaw agentic-edge connect
python3 /workspace/nemoclaw-agent/customer_support_agent.py

# Deep Tech: compare inference profiles
python3 /workspace/nemoclaw-agent/benchmarks/latency-test.py --profile vllm
python3 /workspace/nemoclaw-agent/benchmarks/latency-test.py --profile vllm-steered
```

## Accessing Your Environment

- **Jupyter:** Click "Open Jupyter" in the Brev console — no extra setup
- **SSH:** Use the Brev CLI (`brev shell <instance-name>`) or the SSH command shown in the Brev console
- **API endpoint:** Exposed via Cloudflare tunnel — the URL appears in the Brev console under Networking
- **AI coding tools:** Cursor, Copilot, and Claude are all encouraged — connect them via SSH remote to your Brev instance

---

## Bonus: Run an LLM on Your Laptop with ZeroClaw

Want to see what quantization can do? The **ZeroClaw Code Assistant demo** runs a quantized Llama 3.1 8B (~4.5 GB) directly on your laptop — no GPU, no cloud, no cost for most tasks. Complex requests (architecture review, security audit) automatically route to a cloud model.

```bash
# From the repo's demo/ directory
bash install.sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."   # only needed for cloud-routed tasks
zeroclaw start
```

**On your Brev GPU instance**, you can use vLLM as the backend instead of Ollama for faster inference:

```bash
cp demo/config.vllm.toml ~/.zeroclaw/config.toml
cp demo/skills/*.md ~/.zeroclaw/workspace/skills/
zeroclaw start
```

See the full [demo walkthrough](demo/examples/walkthrough.md) for a guided script with sample code to try.

## Troubleshooting

**vLLM server won't start / OOM error:**
Reduce `--max-model-len` (try 4096 or 2048) or lower `--gpu-memory-utilization` to 0.80.

**Model download seems stuck:**
Models are pre-cached. If they're missing, run: `huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --local-dir /models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`

**Can't access the API externally:**
Check the Cloudflare tunnel URL in the Brev console. If using port-forwarding: `ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 <your-brev-ssh-command>`

**GPU not detected:**
Run `nvidia-smi`. If it fails, your instance may still be provisioning — wait 1-2 minutes and retry.

**Need help?** Raise your hand — core vLLM and llm-d committers are here as mentors.
